# Machine-Learning-for-the-ATLAS-Calorimeter-Trigger
4th year project, for creating a BDT and a QNN for Machine Learning for the ATLAS Calorimeter Trigger.  


Start with data manipulation files, then move on to the BDT and QNN. 
The BDT trains a lot faster so easier to alter the hyperparameters. 
BDT and QNN testing phase is with the current algorithm with ID values 2 and 3.
